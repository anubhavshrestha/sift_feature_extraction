Image Feature Extraction combining SIFT features and Convolutional Neural Networks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This github repository is my contributions on experimenting of SIFT feature extraction for image feature extraction combined with Convolutional Neural Networks, conducted under the mentorship of Professor Tuka Alhanai with Human-Computer Interaction lab at NYU Abu Dhabi. We try to explore the use of SIFT feature transform that employs statistical feature and then feed it into Convolutional Neural Network for the classical image classification task. 

## Goal of the project
The goal of this project was to experiment with various feature imitating network topologies for image domain. Using combined statistical feature extraction and Convolutional Neural Network, we aim to train a combined network that performs better than state-of-the-art techniques.
