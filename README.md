# Image Feature Extraction combining SIFT features and Convolutional Neural Networks

This github repository is my contributions on experimenting of SIFT feature extraction for image feature extraction combined with Convolutional Neural Networks, conducted under the mentorship of Professor Tuka Alhanai with Human-Computer Interaction lab at NYU Abu Dhabi. We try to explore the use of SIFT feature transform that employs statistical feature and then feed it into Convolutional Neural Network for the classical image classification task.
